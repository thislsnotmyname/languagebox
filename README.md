# LanguageBox
This is a static version of a WordPress website called "LanguageBox." It is a blog/learning resource dedicated to [toki pona, the language of good](https://tokipona.org/). toki pona is a constructed language created in 2001 by [Sonja Lang](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/jan_Sonja), known within the community as jan Sonja.
This project's goal was to create a WordPress website on a topic of my choosing. The website needed to offer at least four pages and four posts of content.

This project was created to be my final project in WEB 172 - WordPress I.
